## Getting Started

This project is made with [Flutter Framework](https://www.flutter.dev),  

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Installation and Config
- Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) from official site.
- Setup Environment for [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs) and [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/ios-devs)

## Build Project
- To run and build project run command `flutter build <device-name>`
- To get devices list, run `flutter devices`

### NOTE:
- Also, install build tools for each platforms  to run on that platform. Follow links above.
- **Flutter Desktop is not stable yet** so you might face some issue, till now I have faced few app crashes on desktop but feature is implemented and app is running.
For Linux app you need to build project and run using ```flutter run -d linux```

## Learning
Few things I have used that you can work to understand flutter development.
- [Image Filter Algorithm, an article by me](https://medium.com/@theshivamlko/image-filters-algorithm-721c4189cc54)
- Simple Bloc
- Using RestAPI
- Native Plugin

You can build your own project on this just by changing dart code in `lib` folder.
